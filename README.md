# Apple Data Analysis using Apache Spark
### (End-to-end Data Engineering and ML Project)

Analyzed Apple's dataset to check how many people bought Airpods after buying a Mac or iPhone. Thereafter, using ML and predictive analytics to check future outcomes. Therefore, as we can see this project has 3 phases-

#### Phase 1 | Data Analysis
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
    
#### Phase 2 | Data Engeenering
  - Development of an end-to-end ETL/ELT data pipeline
    
#### Phase 3 | Machine Learning
  - Application of Statistical and mathematical models (Predictive Analytics)
